# Python Control Structures Assignment

## Overview
This assignment is designed to test your understanding of Python control structures, including `while`, `for`, and `if` statements. You will write Python programs that utilize these constructs and verify your solutions using the provided test cases.

## Objectives
- Understand and use `while` loops effectively.
- Implement `for` loops with `continue` and `break` statements.
- Use `if-else` statements to handle conditional logic.
- Write nested loops for more complex logic.
